# ManagementApp

Set up guide:

1. start XCode -> check out an existing project

2. repository location: https://github.com/chrispykim/ManagementApp.git

3. save in whatever folder you see fit

4. in ViewController.swift (navigate around in leftmost bar) you should see the line "// change for initial commit" in the first function

5. now you can do your standard git stuff from the Source Control (on the top). try committing and pushing a change and making sure it shows up here in the repository
